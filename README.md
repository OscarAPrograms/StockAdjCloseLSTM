# Stock-Market-Neural-Network
"Stock-Market-Neural-Network" is a LTSM neural newtork model used to predict the next adjusted closing price of a stock based on statistics (open price, high price, low price, adjusted close price, and volume) from the last 7 days.

Given a user inputted stock ticker, this program downloads up to 10 years of data about that stock (from Yahoo Finance), groups this data into 7 days batches, and predicts the next trading day's adjusted closing price.
